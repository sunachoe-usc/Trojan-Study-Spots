GIT VERSION CONTROL
- When you want to edit the project, only edit what you are assigned (this is to avoid merge conflicts!) if something is wrong with someone else's code tell them immediately and work it out together instead of trying to fix their code collectively.

- before making a branch (you work in like a copy of the code and then push it back to the version everyone has):
  - run git pull to be up-to-date on everyone else's code
    - if anything goes wrong/it won't pull for some reason, it's very stack overflow/chatgpt/ask anyone-a-ble
  - run npm i (this means npm install) because it will update any/all of the imported libraries someone else has done on your local computer

- make a *branch* by navigating to the repo on your device and using "git branch what-you're-doing_firstname"
- add, commit, and push to your branch as you work
- when you want to put everything back on main, make a pull request and select your branch and main
- have someone else review it and they'll basically merge it into main and your branch will disappear
